              <div>
                <p style="font-size: small;">Occupational back-support exoskeletons see their potential
                  application in many industrial sectors to mitigate low back
                  pain risk for workers performing demanding tasks. This work
                  aims to design and evaluate a control strategy that improves the
                  efficacy of an active exoskeleton by exploiting the raw signal from
                  an accelerometer placed on the userâ€™s torso. The designed strategy
                  adapts the assistance to the userâ€™s dynamics during lifting and
                  lowering tasks, increasing the assistance for the lifting phase and
                  decreasing it for lowering. The strategy efficacy is demonstrated
                  through experimental analysis on twenty subjects. Comparisons
                  are made with the task executed without the exoskeleton and a
                  state-of-the-art inclination-based strategy. Results demonstrate the
                  efficacy of the proposed strategy in improving usersâ€™ acceptance
                  and reducing erector spinae muscle activity. Using the accelerometer
                  signal, the exoskeleton can enhance the assistance provided
                  to workers performing manual material handling in real working
                  scenarios, increasing safety, efficiency, and productivity.

                <p style="font-size: small;">The execution of manual material handling activities in the workplace exposes workers
                  to large lumbar loads that increase the risk of musculoskeletal disorders and low back pain. In
                  particular, the redesign of the workplace is making the execution of pulling activities more common,
                  as an alternative to lifting and carrying tasks. The biomechanical analysis of the task revealed
                  a substantial activation of the spinal muscles. This suggests that the user may benefit from the
                  assistance of a back-support exoskeleton that reduces the spinal muscle activity and their contribution
                  to lumbar compression. This work addresses this challenge by exploiting the versatility of an active
                  back-support exoskeleton. A control strategy was specifically designed for assisting pulling that
                  modulates the assistive torques using the forearm muscle activity. These torques are expected
                  to adapt to the userâ€™s assistance needs and the pulled object mass, as forearm muscle activity is
                  considered an indicator of grip strength. We devised laboratory experiments to assess the feasibility
                  and effectiveness of the proposed strategy. We found that, for the majority of the subjects, back muscle
                  activity reductions were associated with the exoskeleton use. Furthermore, subjective measurements
                  reveal advantages in terms of perceived support, comfort, ease of use, and intuitiveness.

                <p style="font-size: small;">To reduce the incidence of occupational musculoskeletal disorders, back-support exoskeletons are being introduced
                  to assist manual material handling activities. Using a device of this type, this study investigates the effects of a new
                  control strategy that uses the angular acceleration of the userâ€™s trunk to assist during lifting tasks. To validate this new
                  strategy, its effectiveness was experimentally evaluated relative to the condition without the exoskeleton as well as
                  against existing strategies for comparison. Using the exoskeleton during lifting tasks reduced the peak compression
                  force on the L5S1 disc by up to 16%, with all the control strategies. Substantial differences between the control
                  strategies in the reductions of compression force, lumbar moment and back muscle activation were not observed.
                  However, the new control strategy reduced the movement speed less with respect to the existing strategies. Thanks to
                  improved timing in the assistance in relation to the typical dynamics of the target task, the hindrance to typical
                  movements appeared reduced, thereby promoting intuitiveness and comfort.

              <div>
                <p style="font-size: small;">Industrial active exoskeletons have recently
                  achieved considerable interest, due to their intrinsic versatility
                  compared to passive devices. To achieve this versatility, an
                  important open challenge is the design of appropriate control
                  strategies to automatically modulate the physical assistance
                  according to the activity the user is performing.
                  This work focuses on active back-support exoskeletons. To
                  improve the assistance provided in dynamic situations with
                  respect to state-of-the-art methods, a new strategy making use
                  of the angular acceleration of the userâ€™s trunk is presented.
                  The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed strategy
                  were tested experimentally on a prototype in a load handling
                  task. The main advantages in terms of assistive torque profiles
                  emerge during the transition phases of the movement (i.e.
                  beginning and end of lowering and lifting) indicating an
                  appropriate adaptation to the dynamics of the execution.
                  In this preliminary evaluation, the data on peak muscular
                  activity at the spine show promising trends, encouraging further
                  developments and a more detailed evaluation.

                <p style="font-size: small;">Background: The large prevalence and risk of
                  occupational lower-back pain and injury associated with manual material handling
                  activities has raised interest in novel technical solutions. Wearable back-support
                  exoskeletons promise to improve ergonomics by reducing the loading on the
                  lumbar spine. Purpose: Since many new prototypes and products are being
                  developed, this article presents an up-to-date overview of the different technologies.
                  By discussing the corresponding advantages and drawbacks, the objective is to
                  promote awareness and communication among developers, ergonomics
                  practitioners, customers, and factory workers. Methods: The state-of-the-art is
                  presented with a focus on three technological aspects: (i) the actuators generating
                  assistive forces/torques, with a main distinction between passive and active devices;
                  (ii) the structures and physical attachments that transfer those forces/torques to the
                  user, with structures being soft, rigid, or a combination of the two; and (iii) the
                  control strategies employed (i.e., how devices adjust assistive forces/torques to
                  accommodate different activities and parameters). Discussion: The choice of
                  actuation technology may determine the applicability of a device to different
                  scenarios. Passive exoskeletons appear more suitable for tasks requiring relatively
                  light assistance and little dynamic movements. By contrast, heavier and more
                  dynamic tasks will justify the use of more complex active exoskeletons. While onboard
                  battery power is increasingly present on active exoskeletons, the tradeoff
                  between power autonomy and additional battery mass will probably depend on the
                  specific application. Most back-support exoskeletons are implemented using rigid
                  articulated structures, which tend to be heavy and bulky, but generate more
                  appropriate patterns of forces. Fewer soft exoskeletons have been developed to date,
                  although they could be integrated with or worn underneath standard working attire
                  and offer greater user comfort. The adoption of any given device will ultimately
                  depend on several factors, including user acceptance and the costs and benefits
                  associated with specific applications.

                <p style="font-size: small;">To mitigate the risk of musculoskeletal disorders
                  and injuries at the back, occupational back-support exoskeletons 
                  are being introduced in the workplace because of their
                  ability to reduce workersâ€™ lumbar loading during the execution
                  of demanding activities. Nevertheless, back-support exoskele-
                  tonsâ€™ assistance has not been developed extensively for activities
                  different from lifting.
                  This work presents a control strategy for an active back-
                  support exoskeleton specifically tailored for assisting carrying
                  task and analyzes the physiological effects on the user. The
                  control strategy modulates the exoskeleton torques to assist
                  the back without hindering the userâ€™s legsâ€™ during gait. A
                  gait phase detection framework that uses sensorized insoles
                  is employed to control the modulation of the assistive torques.
                  The strategy is assessed through an experimental test on nine
                  subjects. Participants performed a simplified carrying task
                  without and with the exoskeleton. The experimental evaluation
                  found a statistically significant increase in the normalized heart
                  rate when using the exoskeleton compared to not using it. No
                  statistically significant changes were found in the mental effort
                  between the conditions with and without the exoskeleton aid.

              <div>
                <p style="font-size: small;">Occupational back-support exoskeletons are becoming a more and more common
                  solution to mitigate work-related lower-back pain associated with lifting activities. In
                  addition to lifting, there are many other tasks performed by workers, such as carrying,
                  pushing, and pulling, that might benefit from the use of an exoskeleton. In this work,
                  the impact that carrying has on lower-back loading compared to lifting and the need
                  to select different assistive strategies based on the performed task are presented. This
                  latter need is studied by using a control strategy that commands for constant torques.
                  The results of the experimental campaign conducted on 9 subjects suggest that such
                  a control strategy is beneficial for the back muscles (up to 12% reduction in overall
                  lumbar activity), but constrains the legs (around 10% reduction in hip and knee ranges
                  of motion). Task recognition and the design of specific controllers can be exploited by
                  active and, partially, passive exoskeletons to enhance their versatility, i.e., the ability to
                  adapt to different requirements.

                <p style="font-size: small;">The risk of low-back pain in manual material handling could potentially be reduced by backsupport
                  exoskeletons. Preferably, the level of exoskeleton support relates to the required muscular
                  effort, and therefore should be proportional to the moment generated by trunk muscle activities. To
                  this end, a regression-based prediction model of this moment could be implemented in exoskeleton
                  control. Such a model must be calibrated to each user according to subject-specific musculoskeletal
                  properties and lifting technique variability through several calibration tasks. Given that an extensive
                  calibration limits the practical feasibility of implementing this approach in the workspace, we aimed
                  to optimize the calibration for obtaining appropriate predictive accuracy during work-related tasks,
                  i.e., symmetric lifting from the ground, box stacking, lifting from a shelf, and pulling/pushing. The
                  root-mean-square error (RMSE) of prediction for the extensive calibration was 21.9 nm (9% of peak
                  moment) and increased up to 35.0 nm for limited calibrations. The results suggest that a set of three
                  optimally selected calibration trials suffice to approach the extensive calibration accuracy. An optimal
                  calibration set should cover each extreme of the relevant lifting characteristics, i.e., mass lifted, lifting
                  technique, and lifting velocity. The RMSEs for the optimal calibration sets were below 24.8 nm (10%
                  of peak moment), and not substantially different than that of the extensive calibration.

                <p style="font-size: small;">Active exoskeletons are potentially more effective and versatile than passive ones, but
                  designing them poses a number of additional challenges. An important open challenge
                  in the field is associated to the assistive strategy, by which the actuation forces are
                  modulated to the userâ€™s needs during the physical activity. This paper addresses this
                  challenge on an active exoskeleton prototype aimed at reducing compressive low-back
                  loads, associated to risk of musculoskeletal injury during manual material handling (i.e.,
                  repeatedly lifting objects). An analysis of the biomechanics of the physical task reveals two
                  key factors that determine low-back loads. For each factor, a suitable control strategy for
                  the exoskeleton is implemented. The first strategy is based on user posture and modulates
                  the assistance to support the wearerâ€™s own upper body. The second one adapts to the
                  mass of the lifted object and is a practical implementation of electromyographic control.
                  A third strategy is devised as a generalized combination of the first two. With these
                  strategies, the proposed exoskeleton can quickly adjust to different task conditions
                  (which makes it versatile compared to using multiple, task-specific, devices) as well as
                  to individual preference (which promotes user acceptance). Additionally, the presented
                  implementation is potentially applicable to more powerful exoskeletons, capable of
                  generating larger forces. The different strategies are implemented on the exoskeleton
                  and tested on 11 participants in an experiment reproducing the lifting task. The resulting
                  data highlights that the strategies modulate the assistance as intended by design, i.e.,
                  they effectively adjust the commanded assistive torque during operation based on
                  user posture and external mass. The experiment also provides evidence of significant
                  reduction in muscular activity at the lumbar spine (around 30%) associated to using the
                  exoskeleton. The reduction is well in line with previous literature and may be associated
                  to lower risk of injury.

                <p style="font-size: small;">In recent years assistive robotics has shown remarkable potential in the human-technology interface across different industries.
                  Logistics activities, and specifically warehousing processes, are particularly challenging and still highly human-intensive although
                  increasingly supported by automation and digital technologies. While the academic literature has started to focus on the Logistics
                  5.0 paradigm, still very little empirical data is offered about assistive technologies applied to the warehousing domain. This
                  phenomenon is even more pronounced for equipment for picking, which is traditionally acknowledged as the most costly and
                  complex warehousing activity. This paper aims at addressing this gap by investigating the role of exoskeletons in supporting picking
                  processes and applying it to an experimental case by comparing three different picking scenarios: picking assisted by an advanced
                  robotics technology, i.e., an active exoskeleton, assisted by a passive exoskeleton, and a case without such technology. Benefits
                  and drawbacks are examined and discussed from a socio-technical perspective.
